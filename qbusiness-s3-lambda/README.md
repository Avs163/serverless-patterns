# Amazon Q Business to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)

This pattern contains a sample AWS SAM stack that leverages Amazon Q Business to build a generative AI application to derive insights from content present in an S3 bucket. An AWS Lambda function initiates the crawling and indexing of the documents present in the specified S3 bucket. Users can then ask questions to the Amazon Q Business application to receive a generated response. 

Important: this application uses various AWS services and there are costs associated with these services after the Free Tier usage - please see the AWS Pricing page for details. You are responsible for any AWS costs incurred. No warranty is implied in this example.

## Requirements
* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [AWS Serverless Application Model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) (AWS SAM) installed
* [Enable AWS IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/get-set-up-for-idc.html)
* [Create Users in AWS IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/addusers.html). Note down the Instance ARN by going to the AWS IAM Identity Center console --> Settings --> Instance ARN. You will require it when deploying the stack.
* [Create an S3 Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html) and [upload documents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/upload-objects.html) that you want to be indexed. If you already have an S3 bucket with data that you want to crawl, you can skip this step.

## Deployment Instructions
1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns
    ```
1. Change directory to the pattern directory:
    ```
    cd qbusiness-s3-lambda
    ```
1. From the command line, use AWS SAM to deploy the AWS resources for the pattern as specified in the template.yml file:
    ```
    sam deploy --guided 
    ```
1. During the prompts:

    * Enter a stack name.
    * Enter the desired AWS Region.
    * Enter the S3 bucket name containing the contents you want to crawl. 
    * Enter the AWS IAM Identity Center Instance ARN noted from the instructions followed in Requirements.
    * Allow SAM CLI to create IAM roles with the required permissions.

    Once you have run `sam deploy --guided` mode once and saved arguments to a configuration file (samconfig.toml), you can use `sam deploy` in future to use these defaults.*

1. Note the outputs from the SAM deployment process. These contain the resource names and/or ARNs which are used for testing.

# How it works
Please refer to the architecture diagram below:

![End to End Architecture](images/architecture.png)

Here's a breakdown of the steps:

**Amazon Q Business Application:** Amazon Q Business application created with S3 as the data source. 

**Amazon S3:** S3 bucket that contains documents to be indexed. 

**AWS Lambda:**  AWS Lambda function `DataSourceSync` crawls and indexes the content from the S3 bucket. The Amazon Q Business application retrieves data from the indexed content and provides a generated response.

## Testing

CLI Lambda invoke with test event:

```bash
aws lambda invoke --function-name INVOKE_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ARN --payload '{"question": "Value" }' output.txt
```

The output.txt will contain the response generated by Amazon Bedrock.

Example JSON Lambda test event:

```
{
    "question": "Value"
}
```

## Cleanup

1. Delete the stack
    ```bash
    sam delete
    ```
