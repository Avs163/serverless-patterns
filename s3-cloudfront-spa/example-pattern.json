      "This pattern deploys the following resources:",
      "- An AWS CloudFront distribution with the following configurations:",
      "- Enabled and IPv6 enabled",
      "- Default root object set to `index.html`",
      "- Allows all HTTP methods for caching",
      "- Redirects HTTP to HTTPS",
      "- Sets custom error responses for 404 and 403 errors to serve `index.html`",
      "- Uses an S3 bucket as the origin",

      "- An S3 bucket to host the SPA content with the following configurations:",
      "- Public access blocked",
      "- Bucket ownership controls set to `BucketOwnerPreferred`",
      "- Access control list (ACL) set to `private`",
      "- Configured for static website hosting with `index.html` as the index document and `error.html` as the error document",
      "- A bucket policy that allows CloudFront to access the bucket objects",

      "The pattern ensures that the SPA content is served securely through CloudFront, while the S3 bucket hosting the content is private and accessible only through CloudFront."
